# ForgeOps - Issue Tracker Tutorial

This tutorial guides you through the basic functionalities of the ForgeOps Issue Tracker CLI.
It's an interactive Python script that:
1.  Explains each command.
2.  Prompts you for any necessary input (like repository names or issue details).
3.  **Executes the command for you.**
4.  Displays the output from the command.

This allows you to see the ForgeOps Issue Tracker in action directly.

## How to Run the Tutorial

1.  Navigate to the root directory of the `forgeops` project in your terminal.
    (This is the directory that contains `main.py` and the `tutorials` folder).
2.  Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
3.  Run the tutorial script using the following command:

    ```bash
    python tutorials/tutorial_issue_tracker.py
    ```

4.  The script will then walk you through the different commands of the issue tracker, running them and showing you the results. For interactive commands like `create-issue`, the script will launch it, and you will interact with its prompts directly in your terminal.

Enjoy learning how to use the ForgeOps Issue Tracker! The repositories and issues created during this tutorial will persist, so you can continue to experiment with them using the CLI tools.
